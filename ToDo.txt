Snapshot Stories: A Collaborative Photography Project

Snapshot Stories is an innovative photography initiative that celebrates storytelling through a unique collaborative approach. The project revolves around the idea of capturing meaningful moments and narratives as participants pass a camera from person to person.

Here's how it works: Each participant begins by receiving a camera from a friend. They are tasked with taking a photo that not only reflects something significant to them or their environment but also includes a picture featuring both the giver (previous participant) and the receiver (current participant) of the camera.

After capturing their photo, participants generate a QR code that links to a brief message about themselves and acknowledges the person who passed them the camera. This QR code, along with the photo featuring the giver and receiver, is then attached to the camera.

The camera is subsequently passed on to another participant, who continues the process by taking their own photo with the giver and receiver included, generating a new QR code message, and passing it along.

This chain continues, creating a collection of photos intertwined with personal stories and connections as the camera travels from one person to the next. Snapshot Stories aims to showcase the diversity of human experiences and perspectives through photography and personal narratives.

At the conclusion of the project, all photos are gathered and QR codes are scanned to reveal the interconnected journey of the camera. This collaborative effort highlights how a simple camera can become a powerful tool for fostering connections and sharing stories within communities and beyond.

Join us in capturing moments, sharing stories, and celebrating the transformative power of photography to connect people from different walks of life.

How to Use a Disposable Camera:

    Advance the Film
    Turn the film advance wheel until it stops to prepare the camera for the next shot. This ensures the film is in the correct position.

    Steady Your Hand and Watch Your Fingers
    Hold the camera steady with both hands. Use the viewfinder window to frame your shot, not the lens window. Keep fingers away from both the lens and flash.

    Consider the Light and Use the Flash
    Use the flash in low light or indoors. Slide the flash switch or press the button to activate it before shooting. Good lighting improves photo quality.

    Get Closer to Your Subject
    Stand 5-10 feet from your subject for clear photos. There is no zoom function, so move closer physically. You are the zoom!

    Make Every Shot Count
    You have a limited number of exposures, so think before you shoot to capture the best moments. Plan your shots to avoid wasting film.

    Protect Your Camera
    Keep the camera dry and free from dust. Store it in a safe place to avoid damage until all shots are taken. Treat it with care to ensure good photo quality.
